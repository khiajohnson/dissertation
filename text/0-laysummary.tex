\chapter{Lay Summary}

Bilingual speech is highly variable---one major source of variability arises from how bilinguals' languages influence one another. This dissertation sheds light on how languages influence each other by analyzing conversations with Cantonese-English bilinguals. In addition to contributing a new open-access data set, this dissertation examines similarity across languages. The first question deals with voice: Do bilinguals have the same voice in each language? Are voices like auditory faces? In short---yes. The second question addresses whether this same group shares P, T, and K sounds across languages---that is, do bilinguals say K the same way in English and Cantonese. The answer to this question is less clear, with variability arising from language and the person. Together, these studies clarify which aspects of speech can be used to recognize individuals speaking more than one language and give insight into how languages do and do not interact in the mind.
