\chapter{Preface}

This dissertation is original work and I am the primary author of each chapter. Additionally, I am the sole author of chapters 1, 4, and 5. All work in this dissertation was covered by the Behavioural Research and Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia under certificate H18-02017. 

Chapter 2 was a collaborative effort. I conceptualized, designed, and led all parts of the corpus development process. The corpus itself was collected by Nancy Yiu, Ivan Fong, and myself. Transcription and annotation was supported by various members of the the Speech-in-Context Lab. The writing in chapter to is based on a paper published in the proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation \citep{johnson_2020_spice}, for which I did the vast majority of writing. 

Chapter 3 is based on a paper published in the proceedings of Interspeech 2020 \citep{johnson_2020_bilingual}. Molly Babel contributed to the conceptualization, design, writing, and revisions. Robert A. Fuhrman contributed tko the design of the methods, and suggested the addition of cannonical correlation anayses. 

Chapter 4 is based on a solo-authored paper published in the proceedings of Interspeech 2021 \citep{johnson_2021_leveraging}. Molly Babel provided early feedback in the design of the study, as well as feedback on an early version of the paper.
