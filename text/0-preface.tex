\chapter{Preface}

This dissertation is original work, and I am the primary author of each chapter. Additionally, I am the sole author of chapters 1, 4, and 5. All work in this dissertation was covered by the Behavioural Research and Ethics Board at the University of British Columbia under certificate H18-02017. 

Chapter 2 was a collaborative effort, and I conceptualized, designed, and led all parts of the corpus development process. The corpus itself was collected by Nancy Yiu, Ivan Fong, and myself. Various members of the Speech-in-Context Lab supported transcription and annotation. The writing in Chapter \ref{ch2:corpus} is based on a paper published in the proceedings of the \textit{12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference} \citep{johnson_2020_spice}, for which I did the vast majority of the writing. 

Chapter 3 is based on a paper published in the \textit{Proceedings of Interspeech 2020} \citep{johnson_2020_bilingual}. Molly Babel contributed to the conceptualization, design, writing, and revisions. Robert A. Fuhrman advised on the methods and suggested the addition of the canonical correlation analyses. 

Chapter 4 is based on a solo-authored paper published in the \textit{Proceedings of Interspeech 2021} \citep{johnson_2021_leveraging}. Molly Babel provided early input regarding the study's design and feedback on a prior version of the paper.
